# 2.01 Activity 4

Refer to `files_for_activities/mysql_dump.sql` database. Load it to Sequel Pro, and there you will find a `bank` database which we will use for the following exercise. This is the same database used for the class example. Keep using the `bank` database for iterations that are related to it (3 and 4).

1. The `select` statement is used as a print command in SQL. Use the `select` statement to print "Hello World".
select "Hello world";

3. Use the select statement to perform a simple mathematical calculation to add two numbers. 
select 5*4;

4. Use an appropriate `select` statement to retrieve a list of unique card types from the `bank` database. (**Hint**: You can use DISTINCT function here.)
select distinct(type) from card;

5. Get a list of all the district names in the bank database. Suggestion is to use the `files_for_activities/case_study_extended` here to work out which column is required here because we are looking for the names of places, not just the IDs. It would be great to see the results under the heading `district_name`. (**Hint**: Use an alias.). You should have 77 rows.
select distinct A2 as district_name from district;

6. Bonus: Revise your query to also show the Region, and limit the results to just 30 rows. Sort the results alphabetically by district name A>Z before selecting the 30.
select distinct A2 as district_name, A3 as region from district order by district_name limit 30;
