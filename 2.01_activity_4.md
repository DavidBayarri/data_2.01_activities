# 2.01 Activity 4

Refer to `files_for_activities/mysql_dump.sql` database. Load it to Sequel Pro, and there you will find a `bank` database which we will use for the following exercise. This is the same database used for the class example. Keep using the `bank` database for iterations that are related to it (3 and 4).

1. The `select` statement is used as a print command in SQL. Use the `select` statement to print "Hello World".
2. Use the select statement to perform a simple mathematical calculation to add two numbers.
3. Use the table card from bank database to get a list of card types.  (Hint: You might have to use keyword "distinct" to get the names of unique cards)
4. Use the table district from bank database to get a list with the name of districts.
